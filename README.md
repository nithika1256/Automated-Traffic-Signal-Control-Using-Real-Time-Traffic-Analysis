# 🚦 Automated Traffic Signal Control Using Real-Time Traffic Analysis

An AI-powered intelligent traffic management system that optimizes traffic signal timings by analyzing live traffic conditions using Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and a Flask-based web application.

The system detects vehicles in real time, predicts traffic congestion, dynamically adjusts signal timings, prioritizes emergency vehicles, and visualizes all traffic information through an interactive dashboard.

---

# 📌 Features

### 🚗 Real-Time Vehicle Detection

* Detects and counts vehicles using **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV**.
* Processes recorded videos or live traffic feeds.

### 🚦 Intelligent Signal Control

* Automatically adjusts traffic signal durations according to current traffic density.
* Reduces unnecessary waiting time and improves traffic flow.

### 🚑 Emergency Vehicle Priority

* Detects ambulances, police vehicles, and fire trucks.
* Creates a virtual green corridor by prioritizing emergency traffic.

### 📊 Traffic Congestion Prediction

* Uses Machine Learning models to estimate congestion levels based on traffic patterns.
* Supports proactive signal optimization.

### 🗄 MongoDB Integration

* Stores vehicle counts, signal timings, congestion predictions, and traffic logs.

### 📈 Interactive Web Dashboard

* Displays live vehicle counts.
* Shows current signal status.
* Visualizes congestion trends using charts.
* Displays emergency alerts in real time.

### 🛣 Four-Way Junction Simulation

* Simulates adaptive traffic control for a four-road intersection.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.10 or later
* MongoDB Community Server (Optional – required only for storing traffic logs and analytics)

**Sample Traffic Video**

```text
ai/dataset/sample_traffic.mp4
```

> **Note:** YOLOv8 model weights will be downloaded automatically during the first execution if they are not already available.

---

# ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

**Windows**

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# ▶️ Running the Application

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and visit:
